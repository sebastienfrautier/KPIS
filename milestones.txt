     - Try different optimizer
     - Currently we have RMSprop in numpy
     - Ideally we would like to investigate Adam, ADAgrad and others
     - http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html



06/12/2017:

     - Run for 10 hours
     - Try with different hyper parameters
     - c.f. Weight decay etc.
     - Look for other hyper parameters



22/11/2017:

     - change Pong environment to Pacman
     - Account for output with softmax
     - Change RMS prob implementation
     - write weights to disc
